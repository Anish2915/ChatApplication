## üìù Overview

Our Chat Application is powered by a combination of robust technologies. C++ forms the backbone, handling core programming logic and backend server implementation. To create a dynamic user interface, we rely on OpenGL with ImGui, offering users an engaging experience. Boost/Asio manages networking, enabling seamless connections between clients and servers for real-time communication. For efficient data handling, RapidJSON ensures swift serialization and deserialization of JSON-formatted messages. MySQL serves as our backend database system, storing user data and chat logs securely. Additionally, we leverage MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based storage of server IP addresses, ensuring reachability to our servers. Together, these technologies form a cohesive and reliable platform for smooth messaging experiences.
